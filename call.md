# Call for Papers

The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO) provides a premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific architectural features and support for code generation and optimization.

Original contributions are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

- Code Generation, Translation, Transformation, and Optimization for performance, energy, virtualization, portability, security, or reliability concerns, and architectural support
- Efficient execution of dynamically typed and higher-level languages
Optimization and code generation for emerging programming models, platforms, 
domain-specific languages Dynamic/static, profile-guided, feedback-directed, and machine learning based optimization
- Static, Dynamic, and Hybrid Analysis for performance, energy, memory locality, throughput or latency, security, reliability, or functional debugging
- Program characterization methods
- Efficient profiling and instrumentation techniques; architectural support
- Novel and efficient tools
- Compiler design, practice and experience
- Compiler abstraction and intermediate representations
- Vertical integration of language features, representations, optimizations, and runtime support for parallelism
- Solutions that involve cross-layer (HW/OS/VM/SW) design and integration
- Deployed dynamic/static compiler and runtime systems for general purpose, embedded system and Cloud/HPC platforms
- Parallelism, heterogeneity, and reconfigurable architectures
- Optimizations for heterogeneous or specialized targets, GPUs, SoCs, CGRA
- Compiler support for vectorization, thread extraction, task scheduling, speculation, transaction, memory management, data distribution and synchronization

Authors should carefully consider the difference in focus with the co-located conferences when deciding where to submit a paper. CGO will make the proceedings freely available via the ACM DL platform during the period from two weeks before to two weeks after the conference. This option will facilitate easy access to the proceedings by conference attendees, and it will also enable the community at large to experience the excitement of learning about the latest developments being presented in the period surrounding the event itself.

This year, CGO has a special category of papers called "tools and 
practical experience". Such a paper is subject to the same page length 
guidelines, except that it must give a clear account of its functionality
and a summary about the practice experience with realistic case studies, 
and describe all the supporting artifacts available. The 
selection criteria are: 

- Foundations: Papers should incorporate the principles underpinning 
Code Generation and Optimization (CGO). However, a thorough discussion of 
theoretical foundations is not required; a summary of such should
suffice.
- Originality: Papers should present CGO-related technologies applied to real-world problems 
with scope or characteristics that set them apart from previous solutions.
- Usability: The presented Tools or compilers should have broad usage or applicability. They are expected
to assist in CGO-related research, or could be extended to investigate or 
demonstrate new technologies. If significant components are not yet 
implemented, the paper will not be considered.
- Documentation: The tool or compiler should be presented on a web-site giving
documentation and further information about the tool.
- Benchmark Repository: A repository of benchmarks for testing should be provided.
- Availability: Preferences will be given to tools or compilers that are freely available
(at either the source or binary level). Exceptions may be made for 
industry and commercial tools that cannot be made publicly available 
for business reasons. 

The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.
